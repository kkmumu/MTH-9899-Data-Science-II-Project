# create a subclass of TimeSeriesSplit
class TimeSeriesSplitImproved(TimeSeriesSplit):
    """Time Series cross-validator
    Provides train/test indices to split time series data samples
    that are observed at fixed time intervals, in train/test sets.
    In each split, test indices must be higher than before, and thus shuffling
    in cross validator is inappropriate.
    This cross-validation object is a variation of :class:`KFold`.
    In the kth split, it returns first k folds as train set and the
    (k+1)th fold as test set.
    Note that unlike standard cross-validation methods, successive
    training sets are supersets of those that come before them.
    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide `.
    Parameters
    ----------
    n_splits : int, default=3
        Number of splits. Must be at least 1.
    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit
    >>> X = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> y = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
    >>> tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=3)
    >>> print(tscv)  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=3)
    >>> for train_index, test_index in tscv.split(X):
    ...    print("TRAIN:", train_index, "TEST:", test_index)
    ...    X_train, X_test = X[train_index], X[test_index]
    ...    y_train, y_test = y[train_index], y[test_index]
    TRAIN: [0] TEST: [1]
    TRAIN: [0 1] TEST: [2]
    TRAIN: [0 1 2] TEST: [3]
    >>> for train_index, test_index in tscv.split(X, fixed_length=True):
    ...     print("TRAIN:", train_index, "TEST:", test_index)
    ...     X_train, X_test = X[train_index], X[test_index]
    ...     y_train, y_test = y[train_index], y[test_index]
    TRAIN: [0] TEST: [1]
    TRAIN: [1] TEST: [2]
    TRAIN: [2] TEST: [3]
    >>> for train_index, test_index in tscv.split(X, fixed_length=True,
    ...     train_splits=2):
    ...     print("TRAIN:", train_index, "TEST:", test_index)
    ...     X_train, X_test = X[train_index], X[test_index]
    ...     y_train, y_test = y[train_index], y[test_index]
    TRAIN: [0 1] TEST: [2]
    TRAIN: [1 2] TEST: [3]
 
    Notes
    -----
    When ``fixed_length`` is ``False``, the training set has size
    ``i * train_splits * n_samples // (n_splits + 1) + n_samples %
    (n_splits + 1)`` in the ``i``th split, with a test set of size
    ``n_samples//(n_splits + 1) * test_splits``, where ``n_samples``
    is the number of samples. If fixed_length is True, replace ``i``
    in the above formulation with 1, and ignore ``n_samples %
    (n_splits + 1)`` except for the first training set. The number
    of test sets is ``n_splits + 2 - train_splits - test_splits``.
